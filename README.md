# Junior-Year-Programming-Language-Proj
Completed this project as part of my Junior year. This script utilizes linked list data structures to parse and execute input files. The project is it's own programming language of sorts, and scans input "code" for syntax errors and compiles it into executable memory. View the Project1.pdf for more info in the ProjectInfo folder.


Relevent code is in parser.cc
